# Using TKG Carvel Packages in TKGs

TKG up to version 1.3 used 'Extentions'. 

However from TKG 1.4 onwards, and in TCE, Carvel 'Packages' are introduced, and Tanzu components will be delivered with these packages going forward. 

TKGs does not currently (feb 2022) install the required framework into Guest clusters to support packages, so these components must be installed prior. This is documented here:
