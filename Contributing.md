# Contributing Guidelines

## Please review the [Content Guidelines](https://github.com/orangeglasses/tanzu-kubernetes-grid-demos/blob/main/Content-Guidelines.md) carefully. 



## Making a pull request

We use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) so all changes should be submitted via a pull request. 

Here are some manuals that explain how this works --> [One](https://opensource.com/article/19/7/create-pull-request-github), two, three

But the basic steps are: 

* Fork this repo, so that you have a copy under your own github account and create your branch from ''main''.
* Clone your fork, so you can work on the code locally
* Create a new ''branch'' that covers the specific additions/work you want to do
* Once you have completed all your work (''commits'') on that branch, push the changes back up to your fork
* In github, in your fork, you should now be able to see a ''Compare & pull request'' button, that allows you to easily make a pull request to this repo
* Once submitted, the maintainer of this repo (Currently, Robert), will review the request and merge it if its ok.
